# members-only
This is my version of the Odin Project "Members-Only" project.
It is a Node server written with Express with Typescript and a React from end also written in Typescript.

The project uses passport authentication to log in users and give them permissions.
The users can enter messages to be seen by the group.
Only members can see the authors of messages.
Only ADMIN users can delete messages.
